AI-driven customer support involves the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and predictive analytics to provide fast, accurate, and personalized assistance to customers.

AI-powered tools such as chatbots and virtual assistants can handle common customer inquiries and issues, freeing up human agents to focus on more complex tasks that require human intervention. Additionally, AI systems can analyze customer data to provide personalized experiences that cater to each customer's unique needs.
